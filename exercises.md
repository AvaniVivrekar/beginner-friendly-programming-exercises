# ex.1
We have variable a and variable b. Both variables have already a stored value. We want to swap those values.

* Example: a = 10, b = 20
* Output: a = 20, b = 10

Warning! Do not use the programming language magic. After you complete the exercise you are free to do so.

# ex.2
It's end of semester and you got your marks from, Geometry, Algebra, Physics classes.

Create a program that:
* Reads the values of these 3 lessons
* Calculate the average of your grades
* Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8
* Output: average_score = 7

Warning! Do not use the programming language magic. After you complete the exercise you are free to do so.

# ex.3
You've bought a Bitcoin and now it's on the rise!!!

Create a program that:
* Read the value that you bought the bitcoin
* Read the percentage of increase(or decrease)
* Prints the total value of your bitcoin
* Prints the increase or decrease value
* Example: bitcoin_value = 10000, bitcoin_increase = 10
* Output: total_bitcoin_value = 11000, bitcoin_increase_value = 1000

# ex.4
You own an estaste and you want to calculate the area.

Create a program that:
* Read the width and height
* Prints the area
* Example: width = 5, height = 2
* Output: area = 10

# ex.5
You are interested in buying crytocurrencies. You want to check with your current amount of money how many coins you can buy
in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.
