# ex.1
We have variable a and variable b. Both variables have already a stored value. We want to swap those values.

* Example: a = 10, b = 20
* Output: a = 20, b = 10

Warning! Do not use the programming language magic. After you complete the exercise you are free to do so.

# ex.2
It's end of semester and you got your marks from, Geometry, Algebra, Physics classes.

Create a program that:
* Reads the values of these 3 lessons
* Calculate the average of your grades
* Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8
* Output: average_score = 7

Warning! Do not use the programming language magic. After you complete the exercise you are free to do so.

# ex.3
You've bought a Bitcoin and now it's on the rise!!!

Create a program that:
* Read the value that you bought the bitcoin
* Read the percentage of increase(or decrease)
* Prints the total value of your bitcoin
* Prints the increase or decrease value
* Example: bitcoin_value = 10000, bitcoin_increase = 10
* Output: total_bitcoin_value = 11000, bitcoin_increase_value = 1000

# ex.4
You own an estaste and you want to calculate the area.

Create a program that:
* Read the width and height
* Prints the area
* Example: width = 5, height = 2
* Output: area = 10

# ex.5
You are interested in buying crytocurrencies. You want to check with your current amount of money how many coins you can buy
in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.

Create a program that:
* Read your amount of money
* Read the read the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin
* Prints the amount of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin you can buy
* Example: money = 100, bitcoin_price = 50, Ethereum = 25, Litecoin = 10
* Output: "With 100$ you can buy 2 Bitcoin, 4 Ethereum, 10 Litecoin

Warning! Obviously the prices are fixed to exercise purpose.

# ex.6
You are interested to buy a new laptop. You check the price and you see that the price is 300$ without 10% tax.

Create a program that:
* Read the price of the laptop
* Read the tax percentage
* Prints the total amount
* Output: "The total price of the laptop is 330$"

# ex.7
In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiply by the employment years, plus 30$ for each employee kid.

Create a program that:
* Read the employment years
* Read the number of each employee kids
* Prints the total amount the employee must take
* Output: "The total amount is 560$, 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids"

# ex.8
The exercise is almost identical to previous exercise with a minor change. In a company the monthly salary of an employee is calculated by minimum wage 400$ per month, plus 20$ multiply by the employment years, plus 30$ for each employee kid, plus 100$ if the employee didn't miss 1 day of work.

Create a program that:
* Read the employment years
* Read the number of each employee kids
* Prints the total amount the employee must take
* Output: "The total amount is 660$, 400$ minimum wage + 100$ for 5 years experience + 60$ for 2 kids + 100$ for not missing a day at work"

# ex.9
The exercise is almost identical to previous exercise with a minor change. It's end of semester and you got your marks from, Geometry, Algebra, Physics classes. If the average score is 7 and above print "Good job!", if the average score is between 6 and 4 print "You need to work harder!", if the average score is below 4 print "Failed, you really need to work harder!".

Create a program that:
* Reads the values of these 3 lessons
* Calculate the average of your grades
* Example: Geometry = 6, Algebra = 7, Physics = 8
* Output: Your average score is 7, Good job!"

# ex.10
Create a program that print the last digit of an integer

Create a program that:
* Read an integer
* Print the last digit

Warning! Do not use the programming language magic. After you complete the exercise you are free to do so.

Warning! Don't try to convert the number into string etc.

Warning! For this problem it's ok after spending some time to look for the solution.

# ex.11
You start working and you are wondering how many things you can buy with the money you've earned. A PS4 cots 200$, a Samsung 900$, a TV 500$, a game skin 9.99$

Create a program:
* Notice that you can't but half TV or 1/4 of PS4.
* Read how many hours you've worked
* Read your hourly income
* Print how many items you can buy
* Output: "I can buy 4 PS4, 1 Samsung, 3 TV, 80 game skin"

# ex.12
You've consumed X amount of Mbps on Wikipedia and Y amount of Mbps on memes. The cost of visiting Wikipedia is 0,10$ per Mb 
and the cost for watching memes is 0,05$ per Mb. If total consumption  is more than 100$ print "Too much consumption".
If watching meme consumption is greater than reading wikipedia consumption print "WOW MANY MEMES", "SUCH LOL"(in new line).

Create a program that:
* Read X(wikipedia Mb consupmtion) and Y(watching meme Mb consumption)
* Calculate the total consumption
* If total consumption greater than 100$ print proper message
* If watching meme consumption  is greater than reading wikipedia articles print proper messages

Warning! For the greater meme consumption you will use one print statement and the output must be in seperate lines
